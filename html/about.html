                When I‚Äôm not working, I love expressing myself through art and creativity. üé® Designing
                graphics and crafting digital content help me turn thoughts into visuals, it's both a passion and a
                form of therapy.
            </p>
            <p>
                I‚Äôm also deeply into  filmmaking  and enjoy telling meaningful stories through video and
                visuals. üì∑ 
            </p>
            <p>
                As someone who enjoys communication and language, I spend time exploring  different cultures and
                    languages . üåç This curiosity often fuels my work and inspires new ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
                In quiet moments, I sit at my keyboard and play the  piano , it helps me relax and
                reconnect. üéπ And when I want a thrill, nothing beats watching a good  horror movie . üëª
