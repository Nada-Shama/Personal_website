            <p>
                When I’m not teaching or studying, I love expressing myself through art and creativity. 🎨 Designing
                graphics and crafting digital content help me turn thoughts into visuals — it's both a passion and a
                form of therapy.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m also deeply into  filmmaking  and enjoy telling meaningful stories through video and
                visuals. 📷 Whether it’s editing or directing, I love every part of the process.
            </p>
            <p>
                As someone who enjoys communication and language, I spend time exploring  different cultures and
                    languages . 🌍 This curiosity often fuels my work and inspires new ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
                In quiet moments, I sit at my keyboard and play the  piano , it helps me relax and
                reconnect. 🎹 And when I want a thrill, nothing beats watching a good  horror movie . 👻
                Yes, the scarier, the better!
